##### I'm a creative thinker and life enthusiast.
To elaborate I'm a ambitious full stack junior web developer filled with energy to quench my thirst for learning, as said looking for a role where i can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to elements related to tech industry i.e strategy, management etc.

Recently i have completed the intensive 12 weeks [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy) (july-Oct 2021) where they taught and instilled on us the best coding practices and to be a mindful coder. Computer science was my high school major where i learned basics of it, later on followed the interest and pursued Computer Systems as UG degree(still pursuing).Passionate about writing code that follows TDD, clean(SRP) and resuable.

Everyone loves game and i started Coding as a result of it, Coding has always been a fun game to me where the result is greater than just statisfaction of problem-solving, it produces and creates something out of your mind and there's so much to it to play around with and it adds value to the world and can ease life. PERFECT COMBO.

## Skills

**Fast-learner** - Having done Makers, i can confidently believe in this notion of myself. Able to quickly grasp new programming language & technolgies efficently as seen by producing our final project on MERN stack without any prior knwoledge within the time frame of two weeks and challenging myself everyday with a quest to find the shortest solution to every problem. In other aspects also i find myself to be a quick learner whether it be producing decent video for my university function without mucch knwolege on editing, creating fun vlogs or making quarantine delicious dish with the help of our beloved internet.

**Commitment** - Being the only international student with different time zone(UAE) in my cohort, i have completed 12 weeks of Makers Academy coding bootcamp(UK) as a remote student during summer vaction of my university. This required alot of discipline, focus, pushing myself to the end goal without getting distracted. Proving myself to be highly motivated and resilient boosted my self-apperciation.

**Team-player** - Truly believe in combined effort and minds produce better work than done single handed. Always been comfortable working in teams whether it be being part of the team & working towards the end goal as being core member of Computer system club in my university or offering leadership when the situation arises as in taking intiative in HULT program for my university. Makers has mostly been about taking and being part of group challenges or pairing everyday which as given me insight on working with different perosnality, background and expressing your thoughts idea in a respectable manner. With daily standups, retro it has encouraged and shown when minds sync with what is needed, greater things can be achieved.

**Adaptable** - i consider new languages, new environments, new teams, new challenge, diversity of people as a opportunity to grow as an individual, there's always way to find your zone and connect with others. Exploring is something i love, you never know what you might find. Having changed countires and schools mutiple times in my life, i have always been able to connect and adapt to the new environment each time, be it at my new school or the new neighborhood or with this summer course me being a international student among the local residents.

**Creative** - i have always been told i have creative mind and i believe i have a very good imagination. Creating funky sketches, making entertaining videos and designing unique outfits is always been my interest. With coding also i believe this comes in handy with problem solving, trying to think out of the box for problems which seems intractable.
